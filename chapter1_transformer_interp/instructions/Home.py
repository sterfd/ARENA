# Chapter 1: Transformer Interpretability

The material on this page covers transformers (what they are, how they are trained, how they are used to generate output) as well as mechanistic interpretability (what it is, what are some of the most important results in the field so far, why it might be important for alignment) and other topics related to interpretability (function vectors & model steering).

Some highlights from this chapter include:

* Building your own transformer from scratch, and using it to sample autoregressive output
* Using the [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) library developed by Neel Nanda to locate induction heads in a 2-layer model
* Finding a circuit for [indirect object identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) in GPT-2 small
* Intepreting model trained on toy tasks, e.g. classification of bracket strings, or modular arithmetic
* Replicating Anthropic's results on [superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html), and training sparse autoencoders to recover features from superposition
* Using [steering vectors](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector) to induce behavioural changes in GPT2-XL

Unlike the first chapter (where all the material was compulsory), all sections of this chapter are optional extensions other than the first two exercise sets. In these first two sets you will build and train transformers, and gain a basic understanding of mechanistic interpretability of transformer models which includes induction heads & use of TransformerLens. After this, you can pick any of the other six sets of exercises you want - there are no prerequisites!

If you've finished the compulsory material and are choosing between the other six sets of exercises, we weakly recommend choosing one of the first three (IOI, superposition, and function vectors). IOI should appeal to the experimentalists, superposition to the theorists / mathematicians, and function vectors to the engineers, so there's something for everyone!

Additionally, each optional set of exercises includes a lot of suggested bonus material / further exploration once you've finished, including suggested papers to read and replicate.

infos = {
    "optimus": ("Transformer from Scratch", r"""
This is a clean, first principles implementation of GPT-2 in PyTorch. The architectural choices closely follow those used by the TransformerLens library (which you'll be using a lot more in later exercises).

The exercises are written to accompany Neel Nanda's [TransformerLens library](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) for doing mechanistic interpretability research on GPT-2 style language models. We'll be working with this library extensively in this chapter of the course.
"""),
    "lens2": ("Intro to Mech Interp", r"""
These pages are designed to get you introduced to the core concepts of mechanistic interpretability, via Neel Nanda's **TransformerLens** library.

The common thread of the exercises is **induction circuits**. Induction circuits are a particular type of circuit in a transformer, which can perform basic in-context learning.
"""),
    "leaves": ("Indirect Object Identification", r"""
This notebook / document is built around the [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper, in which the authors aim to understand the **indirect object identification circuit** in GPT-2 small. This circuit is resposible for the model's ability to complete sentences like `"John and Mary went to the shops, John gave a bag to"` with the correct token "`" Mary"`.

The flavour of these exercises is experimental and loose, with a focus on demonstrating what exploratory analysis looks like in practice with the transformerlens library. They skimp on rigour, and instead try to speedrun the process of finding suggestive evidence for this circuit. The later sections take a slightly more rigorous approach, replicating some of the results from the IOI paper.
"""),
    "galaxies": ("Superposition & Sparse Autoencoders", r"""
Superposition is a crucially important concept for understanding how transformers work. A definition from Neel Nanda's glossary:

*\"Superposition is when a model represents more than n features in an $n$-dimensional activation space. That is, features still correspond to directions, but **the set of interpretable directions is larger than the number of dimensions**.\"*

The exercises here are split into three main sections (described in more detail below). The first three sections introduce Anthropic's toy models of superposition, and show how this model can illustrate important concepts about superposition. The next two sections dive deeper into specific lines of research that grew from the toy model setup. The last two sections introduce **sparse autoencoders**, an exciting line of research which hopes to solve the barriers to interpretability which superposition presents.
"""),
    "fv_header": ("Function Vectors & Model Steering", r"""
These exercises serve as an exploration of the following question: ***can we steer a model to produce different outputs / have a different behaviour, by intervening on the model's forward pass using vectors found by non gradient descent-based methods?***

The exercises also take you through use of the `nnsight` library, which is designed to support this kind of work (and other interpretability research) on very large language models - i.e. larger than models like GPT2-Small which you might be used to at this point in the course.
"""),
    "othello": ("OthelloGPT", r"""
These exercises explore the OthelloGPT model, which is a GPT-2-like model trained on the Othello dataset. The model is trained to predict the next move in a game of Othello, given the current board state. The model is trained on a dataset of 1.5 million games, and achieves a 90% accuracy on the test set.

The paper [Emergent World Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13382) investigates whether the model has an interpretable board state. They discover it does, but this board state isn't represented linearly. Neel Nanda built on this paper's results, showing that a linear board state does exist. We will reproduce his results, and take deeper dives investigating particular circuits and neurons in the OthelloGPT model.
"""),
    "gears2": ("Balanced Bracket Classifier", r"""
When models are trained on synthetic, algorithmic tasks, they often learn to do some clean, interpretable computation inside. Choosing a suitable task and trying to reverse engineer a model can be a rich area of interesting circuits to interpret!

In these exercises, we'll interpret a 3-layer transformer which was trained to perform **bracket classification**, i.e. taking a string of parentheses like `"(())()"` and trying to output a prediction of "balanced" or "unbalanced". We will find an algorithmic solution for solving this problem, and reverse-engineer one of the circuits in our model that is responsible for implementing one part of this algorithm.
"""),
    "wheel3-2": ("Grokking and Modular Arithmetic", r"""
Our goal for these exercises is to reverse-engineer a one-layer transformer trained on modular addition! It turns out that the circuit responsible for this involves discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities.

We will also go deeper than just analysing the model's final learned solution; we'll also look at the model's training over time, and find evidence of **grokking** - when the model rapidly goes from a high test loss to near zero. We'll investigate why this grokking happens, and ways it can be predicted.

## About this page

This page was made using an app called Streamlit. It's hosted from the main course [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0). It provides a very simple way to display markdown, as well as more advanced features like interactive plots and animations. This is how the instructions for each day will be presented.

On the left, you can see a sidebar (or if it's collapsed, you will be able to see if you click on the small arrow in the top-left to expand it). This sidebar should show a page called `Home` (which is the page you're currently reading), as well as one for each of the different parts of today's exercises.

If you want to change to dark mode, you can do this by clicking the three horizontal lines in the top-right, then navigating to Settings → Theme.

## How to access the course

### Option 1: Colab

This option is recommended if either of the following is true:

* You have limited access to GPU support
* You want to avoid the hassle of setting up your own environment

You can see all the Colab files in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tjayfX21o9c8pwVNCDlIkAMcNt_xtp8A?usp=sharing). Also, you can get individual links in the dropdown below.

</details>

For each of these sections, you can make a copy of the **exercises** notebooks in your own drive, and fill in the code cells whenever indicated. Use the **solutions** notebook when you're stuck (they have all code cells filled in & run, and output displayed).

### Option 2: VSCode

This is the option we strongly recommend for all participants of the in-person ARENA program, and for people who are more comfortable with things like setting up their coding workspace (and who have access to a good GPU).

<details>
<summary>Click this dropdown for setup instructions.</summary>

First, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0) into your local directory. The repo has the following structure (omitting the unimportant parts):

```
.
├── chapter0_fundamentals
├── chapter1_transformer_interp
│   ├── exercises
│   │   ├── part1_transformer_from_scratch
│   │   │   ├── solutions.py
│   │   │   ├── tests.py
│   │   │   └── answers.py*
│   │   ├── part2_intro_to_mech_interp
│   │   ⋮    ⋮
│   └── instructions
│       └── Home.py
├── chapter2_rl
└── requirements.txt
```

There is a directory for each chapter of the course (e.g. `chapter0_fundamentals`). Each of these directories has an `instructions` folder (which contain the files used to generate the pages you're reading right now) `exercises` folder (where you'll be doing the actual exercises). The latter will contain a subfolder for each day of exercises, and that folder will contain files such as `solutions.py` and `tests.py` (as well as other data sometimes, which gets used as part of the exercises). To do the exercises, you'll be creating a file `answers.py` (or `.ipynb` if you prefer) in the same folder as the solutions and tests files. You'll then go through the corresponding streamlit page, copying over & running code (filling in the blanks as you go).

You'll be completing the exercises in an `answers.py` (or file in this subfolder (which you'll need to create).

Once you've cloned the repo and navigated into it (at the root directory), follow these steps:

* Make & activate a virtual environment.
    * We strongly recommend using `conda` for this. You can install `conda` [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), and find basic instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
    * The command for creating a new env is `conda create --name arena python=3.11`.
* Install requirements.
    * First, install PyTorch.
        * If you're on Windows, the command is `conda install pytorch=1.13.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia`.
        * If you're on MAC/Linux, the command is `conda install pytorch=1.13.1 torchvision`.
    * Then install the rest of the requirements by navigating to the root directory for ARENA 3.0, and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
</details>

Note - if you choose this option, then you may require more compute than your laptop can provide. If you're following this material virtually, you may want to consider a cloud provider such as Lambda Labs or RunPod. If one of these doesn't have capacity (Lambda Labs has been very busy recently), then hopefully the other one will have some GPUs available.

*If the following setup instructions don't work for you, please let us know - there are many different errors that can be encountered during VM setup, and we're keen to try and make these instructions more robust and helpful.*

<details>
<summary>Setup instructions for Lambda Labs.</summary>

### Instructions for signing up

Sign up for an account [here](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud).

Add an **SSH key** (Lambda Labs gives you an option to create one). Give it a name like `lambda_labs_key` (we will refer to this as `<keyname>` from now on).

When you create it, it will automatically be downloaded. The file may have a `.pem` extension - this is a common container format for keys or certificates.

<br>

### VSCode remote-ssh extension

The [**remote ssh extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is very useful for abstracting away some of the messy command-line based details of SSH. You should install this extension now.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/architecture-ssh.png" width="600">

At this point, the instructions differ between Windows and Linux/MacOS.

##### Windows

Having installed the SSH extension, Windows may have automatically created a .ssh file for you, and it will be placed in `C:\Users\<user>` by default. If it hasn't done this, then you should create one yourself (you can do this from the Windows command prompt via `md C:\Users\<user>\.ssh`).

Move your downloaded SSH key into this folder. Then, set permissions on the SSH key:
        
* Right click on file, press “Properties”, then go to the “Security” tab.
* Click “Advanced”, then “Disable inheritance” in the window that pops up.
    
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction1.png" width="500">

* Choose the first option “Convert inherited permissions…”

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction2.png" width="500">

* Go back to the “Security” tab, click "Edit" to change permissions, and remove every user except the owner.
    * You can check who the owner is by going back to "Security -> Advanced" and looking for the "Owner" field at the top of the window).

##### Linux / MacOS

* Make your `.ssh` directory using the commands `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` then `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`.
* Set permissions on the key: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<keyname>`

<br>

### Launch your instance

Go back to the Lambda Labs website, navigate to "instances", and click "Launch instance".

You'll see several options, some of them might be greyed out if unavailable. Pick an A100 if possible; otherwise an A10 will also do for most exercises in this course.

Enter your SSH key name. Choose a region (your choice here doesn't really matter for our purposes).

Once you finish this process, you should see your GPU instance is running:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_instance.png" width="700">

You should also see an SSH LOGIN field, which will have the form `ssh <user>@<ip-address>`.

Now, you should set up a **config file** - this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/<keyname> user@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shif+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host lambdalabs
    HostName <ip-address>
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    User <user>
```

where `<ip-address>` and `<user>` come from the **SSH LOGIN** field in the table, and `<path-to-ssh-key>` is the path at which you saved the SSH key. So from my Windows machine, this would look like:

```c
Host lambdalabs
    HostName 150.136.64.192
    IdentityFile C:/Users/calsm/.ssh/lambda_labs_key
    User ubuntu
```

<br>

### Connect to your instance

Open the command palette, and search for & choose the option "Connect to Host...". The host `lambdalabs` should appear as one of the hosts. Choose this option.

A new VSCode window will open up. If you're asked if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, click yes. If you're asked to choose an OS (Windows, Mac or Linux), choose Linux.

Click on the file explorer icon in the top-left, and open the directory `ubuntu` (or whichever directory you want to use as your working directory in this machine). 

And there you go - you're all set! 

To check your GPU is working, you can open a Python or Notebook file and run `!nvidia-smi`. You should see GPU information which matches the machine you chose from the Lambda Labs website, and is different from the result you get from running this command on your local machine. 

Another way to check out your GPU For instance is to run the PyTorch code `torch.cuda.get_device_name()`. For example, this is what I see after SSHing in:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type.png" width="500">
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type_2.png" width="450">

You can also use `torch.cuda.get_device_properties` (which takes your device as an argument).

Once you've verified this is working, you can start running code on GPUs. The easiest way to do this is just to drag and drop your files into the file explorer window on the left hand side.

<br>

### Set up your workspace

You might already know how to do this, but here are the steps I go through (thanks to Arthur Conmy for most of these!).

1. Open a terminal, with `Ctrl + Shift + '`.
2. Run `git clone <repo-url>`, where `<repo-url>` is the URL of the GitHub repo you want to clone.
    * In the case of ARENA 3.0, the repo url is `git@github.com:callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git`.
    * In the case of general repositories, you should go to the GitHub page, click on the `Code` button, and copy the SSH URL.
3. Install extensions (Python, Jupyter, Copilot) using the extensions tab on the left.
4. Install & activate miniconda using:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Exit the terminal, and open it again. Run the following code to create a new conda environment, and open it by default (feel free to name your environment whatever you want):

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11 -y
conda activate myenv
echo "conda activate myenv" >> ~/.bashrc
```

6. Install requirements. This requires running `cd ARENA_3.0` first, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

7. Whenever you open a python file, make sure the interpreter is `myenv`. If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, you can change the kernel by clicking on the `Kernel` tab, then `Change kernel`, then `myenv`.

See the **prerequisites section** (left-hand sidebar) for more advice on using VSCode.

<summary>Setup instructions for RunPod.</summary>

### Instructions for signing up

Sign up for an account [here](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup).

Add an **SSH key**, by running the command `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` (in Windows PowerShell if you're using Windows, or Terminal if you're using Linux / MacOS). Give it a name like `runpod_key` (we will refer to this as `<keyname>` from now on). Make sure you know where it was generated (later in the instructions, you'll move it into the right folder).

You'll see several options, some of them might be greyed out if unavailable. Pick an A100 if possible; otherwise an A10 will also do for most exercises in this course.

Click "Deploy" on your chosen machine. A new options menu will open. Do the following:

* You can click on the "Customize Deployment" button, to give yourself more storage (I usually go with 50GB on Container Disk (Temporary) and 50GB on Volume Disk (Persistent). You might be told that there isn't enough capacity when you try to deploy, in which case go back to this menu and make the amount smaller). Click "Set Overrides".
* In the "Type to search for a template" option, choose the version of PyTorch less than version 2 (this will probably be 1.13.1).
* Click "Continue", then "Deploy" - this should launch your instance.

Enter your SSH key name. Choose a region (your choice here doesn't really matter for our purposes).

Once you finish this process, you should see your GPU instance is running, when you navigate to "Pods" on the left hand sidebar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/runpod-instructions.png" width="980">

Click the purple dropdown button on the right, and press "Connect". Click on the "TCP Port Mappings" tab. You should see something like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/runpod-instructions-2.png" width="480">

You can see the IP address `104.255.9.187` (which we'll call `<ip-address>` from now on), and the external port `13212` (which we'll call `<port>` from now on).

*(Note - sometimes I don't see any IP addresses in this option, instead the message "This pod either does not support direct public ip networking, or you have not exposed any tcp ports." I don't know exactly why this happens, but starting a new machine with less extra storage often fixes this for me.)*

Now, you should set up a **config file** - this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/<keyname> user@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shif+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host runpod
    HostName <ip-address>
    User root
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    Port <port>
```

With all values filled in.

### Connect to your instance

Open the command palette, and search for & choose the option "Connect to Host...". The host `lambdalabs` should appear as one of the hosts. Choose this option.

A new VSCode window will open up. If you're asked if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, click yes. If you're asked to choose an OS (Windows, Mac or Linux), choose Linux.

Click on the file explorer icon in the top-left, and open the directory `ubuntu` (or whichever directory you want to use as your working directory in this machine). 

And there you go - you're all set! 

To check your GPU is working, you can open a Python or Notebook file and run `!nvidia-smi`. You should see GPU information which matches the machine you chose from the RunPod website, and is different from the result you get from running this command on your local machine. 

Another way to check out your GPU For instance is to run the PyTorch code `torch.cuda.get_device_name()`. For example, this is what I see after SSHing in:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpuone.png" width="550">
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gputwo.png" width="380">

You can also use `torch.cuda.get_device_properties` (which takes your device as an argument).

Once you've verified this is working, you can start running code on GPUs. The easiest way to do this is just to drag and drop your files into the file explorer window on the left hand side.

### Set up your workspace

You might already know how to do this, but here are the steps I go through (thanks to Arthur Conmy for most of these!).

1. Open a terminal, with `Ctrl + Shift + '`.
2. Run `git clone <repo-url>`, where `<repo-url>` is the URL of the GitHub repo you want to clone.
    * In the case of ARENA 3.0, the repo url is `git@github.com:callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git`.
    * In the case of general repositories, you should go to the GitHub page, click on the `Code` button, and copy the SSH URL.
3. Install extensions (Python, Jupyter, Copilot) using the extensions tab on the left.
4. Install & activate miniconda using:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Exit the terminal, and open it again. Run the following code to create a new conda environment, and open it by default (feel free to name your environment whatever you want):

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11 -y
conda activate myenv
echo "conda activate myenv" >> ~/.bashrc
```

6. Install requirements. This requires running `cd ARENA_3.0` first, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

7. Whenever you open a python file, make sure the interpreter is `myenv`. If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, you can change the kernel by clicking on the `Kernel` tab, then `Change kernel`, then `myenv`.

See the **prerequisites section** (left-hand sidebar) for more advice on using VSCode.

## Structure of the exercise sets

Each set of exercises is designed to take 1 day or more. Each set is structured as follows:

* Reading material (most, but not all exercises will start with reading material),
* Setup (a code block for you to run to make all the relevant imports / definitions),
* Exercises.

You should read through the reading material as indicated, run the setup code, and then work through the exercises sequentially.

The exercises will be split up into subsections (usually between 3 and 6 subsections). For instance, a set of exercises with 3 sections might be indicated with 30%, 20%, 50% on the left-hand contents bar. These are also just a rough guide, designed to help you plan your time as you go through the exercises. In this chapter, the first two sets of exercises are designed to take 1 day each, and most other sets are designed to take 2 days to get through all the core material.

There will usually be around 10-30 total exercises per set, spread over the subsections.

## Structure of individual exercises

Each exercise will come with a description of what you need to do (usually in the form of a function with a docstring which you need to complete), as well as a test function you can run to check your answer. These tests are designed to try and catch most possible ways your function can go wrong, although they won't always be able to capture all possible errors (especially in later chapters). Exercises will also come with estimates for how difficult they are, and how important they are (relative to other exercises in that set). For example, they may look like this:

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

These are only rough guidelens to help you calibrate yourself as you go through the exercises, and the times will vary depending on your coding speed & level of familiarity with the material. However, if you're spending *much* more than the suggested time on the exercise, then you should consider using the provided solution & moving on to the next exercise. In these cases, do try to read & understand the solution provided, since it's likely to be useful for subsequent exercises.

Exercises will sometimes come with hints, in dropdowns like this one:

<details>
<summary>Click me to see how hints work, and to read more about hints.</summary>

Here is the contents of the hint!

Hints should be used liberally. They're designed to help you skip over parts of the exercise which might cause you to be stuck for a long time, so you can focus on the more important parts of the exercise set as a whole.

You can also use our experimental chatbot assistant to answer questions about the course (navigate to it from the left-hand sidebar). This was inspired by [AlignmentSearch](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bGn9ZjeuJCg7HkKBj/introducing-alignmentsearch-an-ai-alignment-informed), and has similar benefits and drawbacks relative to the alternative of using GPT directly.

# ## Support

# If you ever need help, you can send a message on the ARENA Slack channel `#technical-questions`. You can also reach out to a TA (e.g. Callum) if you'd like a quick videocall to talk through a concept or a problem that you've been having, although there might not always be someone available.

# You can also read the solutions by downloading them from the [GitHub](https://github.com/callummcdougall/arena-v1). However, ***this should be a last resort***. Really try and complete the exercises as a pair before resorting to the solutions. Even if this involves asking a TA for help, this is preferable to reading the solutions. If you do have to read the solutions, then make sure you understand why they work rather than just copying and pasting. 

# At the end of each day, it can be beneficial to look at the solutions. However, these don't always represent the optimal way of completing the exercises; they are just how the author chose to solve them. If you think you have a better solution, we'd be really grateful if you could send it in, so that it can be used to improve the set of exercises for future ARENA iterations.
